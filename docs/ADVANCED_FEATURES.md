## Use Cases
For each of the use cases below, click on the arrow in order to get to the relevant feature.
1. I want to load environment variables before every task ([⏩](custom-runners))
2. I want to run all tasks in a specific virtualenv ([⏩](custom-runners))
3. I want to run all tasks in a specific shell \ ssh ([⏩](custom-runners))

## Features
### Custom Runners
#### Requirement
Under some circumstances, we would like to run all of our tasks in a consistent context; e.g., in a specific shell, a remote shell with `ssh`, some custom `virtualenv` wrapper, or even `dotenv`.

Currently, we can configure this on a task to task basis, e.g.:
```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
test = "dotenv run unittest ."
```

But if we want all of our tasks to use the same runner (such as `dotenv` in the above example) we would have to manually write all of them as such:
```toml
[tool.taskipy.settings]
runner = "dotenv run"

[tool.taskipy.tasks]
test = "dotenv run unittest ."
lint = "dotenv run pylint taskipy"
release = "dotenv run release-it"
start = "dotenv run python ."
...
```

And so on.

Such cases are where we need a global wrapper, so we wouldn't have to repeat the prefix with every command.

#### Solution
The `tool.taskipy.settings.runner` option: when configured, adds the given runner command as a prefix to every task we run.

Let's take a look at the following example, where we want to load environment variables before every task:
```toml
[tool.taskipy.settings]
runner = "dotenv run"

[tool.taskipy.tasks]
test = "unittest ."
lint = "pylint taskipy"
```

Now, running `task test` will actually run:
```bash
dotenv run unittest .
```

Which means that we implicitly initialize the env before every task.
